      <description>I am (at the time of writing this) in my second year at the University of Bristol, studying Mathematics. I&#39;m particularly interested in weird maths problems that have unexpected outcomes, which is mainly what I blog about here, as well as the really satisfying nice links you get between different branches of mathematics, like matricies being really important in graph theory, and basically every branch of mathematics is used in machine learning, from calculus, to statistics, to game theory!</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
As my first official blog post, I decided to further investigate a topic that I already have prior knowledge of, and a rather non-controversial one at that, but still one that has quite a weird and interesting result.
&lt;/p&gt;</description>
